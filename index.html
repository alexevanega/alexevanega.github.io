                <p>My name is Alexander Robert Evanega but you can call me Alex. I am 31 years old and my background is primarily
                in supply chain and logistics, specifically in distribution, but I have experience in many different fields. I have a desire to learn as much as I can,
                about as many different things as I can. I have worked in: HVAC, auto mechanics, inventory management, landscaping, and sales. I want to add programming
                to my skillset so that I can start a career in a field that will be much more intellectually stimulating.</p>

                <p>I am hoping to start my career in programming or developing as soon as I possibly can. I know that it is a skill I can prosper with and benefit greatly from.
                    It is still too early to tell if I will prefer front-end, back-end, or even going all in with full-stack, but I am excited to learn and ready to put my new 
                    found skills to good use in the near future!!

                <h2>My Life Currently</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="current-life-info">
                <p>As of right now, I live in Charlotte, NC with my girlfiend, Kathryn, and our dog, Grace(Both seen on left). They are, without a doubt, the best thing that has ever happened to me. Kathryn 
             has been so supportive, especially when it comes to improving my life. When I decided to attend programming boot camp, she did not hesitate to stand behind me 100% and 
             do whatever she could to help me finish the program. Grace is our pride and joy. She is very sweet and loving. She just loves to be the center of attention, and we are 
             all to happy to indulge her.</p>
                <p>My interests are: sports, movies, reading, writing, music, trivia, crosswords, and history.</p>
                <p>I enjoy singing but only as a hobby or a way to pass the time. I never wanted to make it a job because I felt I would enjoy it less. I love going to 
             all kinds of sporting events, whether it is a Charlotte Hornets game, a Panthers game, or a NASCAR race. I currently work as an inventory associate for the 
             Stanley Black and Decker distribution warehouse in Kannapolis, NC, but look forward to changing that soon. When I am not working, you can find me at home reading, writing, 
             or most recently, practicing my programming/developing skills. I also enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee whenever I get the chance.</p>
